Highlighting- Current Issues :

1) Full of HACKS : Just meant for understanding various aspects of implementing text-markup annotations.
2) Quite a lot of warnings.

CRITICAL :

Segmentaion faults whenever:

1) no. of lines (rectangles) exceeds 1.
2) special text like italics, super/sub script, bold, underline, rotated, different font(?) is encountered.


Other feature related issues :

1) Markup window not attached to highlighted rect by default. Becomes active when SAVED and Reloaded.
2) Annotation list tree.
3) Add toggle button doesn't toggle after button release.
4) Empty highlights created.
5) View not reloading properly - going back (reducing size) , right to left highlighting.!

These are just some of many, this is a WIP.
