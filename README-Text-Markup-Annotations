Highlighting- Current Issues :

1) Full of HACKS : Just meant for understanding various aspects of implementing text-markup annotations.
2) Quite a lot of warnings.

CRITICAL :

Major memory leak somewhere while updating selection.

Other issues :

0) Selection - try handling similar to text selection.?

1) Markup window not attached to the entire text, only the view_rect passed.  Becomes active when SAVED and Reloaded.
   NEEDS WORK - set markup as set of quads/rects rather than one : to enable popup for multiple lines (different sizes/dimensions)..

2) Annotation list tree.
3) Should allow multiple highlights to be added without toggling button again.
4) Empty highlights created.
5) View not reloading properly - entire page is being reloaded right now.

These are just some of many, this is a WIP.
